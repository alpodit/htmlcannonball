# HTML Cannon Ball and Physics Implementation

This project is about physics implementation. I followed the tutorial [https://youtu.be/Zdicf60eNzA?si=-kopFqJsSY5KZ80U](https://youtu.be/Zdicf60eNzA?si=-kopFqJsSY5KZ80U)
to understand how some of the javascript functions work.

## Simulation Parameters

Then I added the controls of speed, mass, radius, gravity, friction and elasticity.

## Conclusion

It was fun project to be familiar with html canvas element and javascript itself.
